# Linear Model & Titanic Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my repository! It contains two major projects: one focusing on Titanic survival prediction using machine learning, and the other on linear regression for ecommerce data analysis.

## Projects:

### 1. **Titanic Machine Learning**:
- This project uses machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.
- It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

### 2. **Linear Regression Model for Ecommerce**:
- This notebook demonstrates how to apply linear regression to ecommerce data.
